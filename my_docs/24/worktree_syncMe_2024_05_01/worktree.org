These are notes for git worktree talk

Git worktrees: A way to manage multiple branches

* Motivation:
** I have (too-)many repos
** Most only have the "main" branch
** Two projects (Lmod and XALT) have more than one active branch
** I find switching between main and testing branches in the same directory tree usually unhelpful.
** I want both branches to be in their own directory tree.
** I used to have multiple clones littered over my $HOME directories but thing could get lost
* git worktree allows for multiple branches to be open at the same time from a single clone
* Show it
