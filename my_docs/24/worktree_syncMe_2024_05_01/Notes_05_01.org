Ideas for git-worktree & SyncMeTool

* I like to find ways to improve my workflow and let software remember things so I don't have to
* I have 34 git repos on my TACC laptop and 22 git repos on Frontera
* For example:
** I have all my dotfiles and common scripts in a repo (.up)
** My g repo has common hello world programs in C, C++, F90, and MPI versions
** And of course Lmod and XALT repos
* I develop on my Laptop and test on Frontera, LS6 and S3
* I need a way to keep all my repos up-to-date
