SyncMeTool: If you have more that one git repo to manage.  This tool
could be a help

* Motivation:
** I like to find ways to improve my workflow and let software remember things so I don't have to
** I have 28 git repos on my TACC laptop and 22 git repos on Frontera
** For example:
*** I have all my dotfiles and common scripts in a repo (.up)
*** My g repo has common hello world programs in C, C++, F90, and MPI versions
*** And of course Lmod and XALT repos
** I develop on my Laptop and test on Frontera, LS6 and S3
** I need a way to keep all my repos up-to-date
** I created a Lua based tool called syncMe which can be found at:
   github.com/TACC/SyncMeTool
** It contains all the lua scripts need to run "syncMe"
* Install:
** To install: Follow the README.md found at    github.com/TACC/SyncMeTool
** TLDR:
*** Install lua and luaposix if necessary
*** clone repo
*** Put SyhcMeTool/bin in your path
* Usage:
** Set $SyncDirPath to a list of repos in a colon separated list
*** paths w/o leading "/" are assumed to be in $HOME
** syncMe status (or syncMe st)
*** Loops over directories found in $SyncDirPath by search for a .git dir/file
*** Runs git status in those directories
*** Removes "unnecessary" output
*** Sets error status on exit if there is a repo that is not up-to-date
** syncMe pull (or syncMe up)
*** Loops over directories found in $SyncDirPath by search for a .git dir/file
*** run git pull in those directories
** syncMe loops over directories in order
*** However any non-ignored output is saved to the end
** syncMe -D ...
*** will show the buffered output
